## Description

<!-- ‚òùÔ∏è replace this description with a description of your own work -->

This project is a single page application in vanilla JavaScript that allows you to scan products and get their nutritional values and scores.

## User story
As a person who follows a strict diet, I want to be able to quickly find products and see their nutritional value and maybe save them for groceries, so I can make more informed decisions within my diet and/or grocery shopping.

The app should at least render the index page when the app is offline because the list is saved there.
